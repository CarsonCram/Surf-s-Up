After pressing the "surf" button the user will arrive at a full map of San Diego with static clickable markers that will present them with ratings based on the above formula

Upon clicking the marker the user will be zoomed in to the area of the beach where they will be presented with more information including time to arrive, weather conditions, and possibly the formula for the rating.

To-Do's
-the most important step here is learning and implemetning the maps API so that I can start building custom markers, tracking users, and creating a zoom system on marker click.
-I don't want to insert a login system if I don't have to because it doesn't seem very necessary but I'll come back to that idea as the project progresses.
